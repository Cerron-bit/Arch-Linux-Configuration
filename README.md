# Arch-Linux-Configuration

These are the dotfiles for my personal Arch setup.
They are intended for working inside a VM, thus no battery information or other connections like wifi are shown in the status bar.
However the `setup` script will still check if virtualization is present and dynamically configure the `.xinitrc` either for running inside a VM or on hardware.

Please note that the wallpaper shown in this screenshot is not part of the project.
After executing the `setup` script, you need to provide a wallpaper of your choice as png.
This can be done by placing the wallpaper into the `wallpaper` directory, which is created by `setup`.
If you want to have the same wallpaper as in the screenshots, please get it from the original artist: https://www.deviantart.com/dannielle-lee/art/Polish-It-the-mourning-735692588
